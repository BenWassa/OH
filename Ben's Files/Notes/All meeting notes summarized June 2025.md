# Marketing Plan Meeting Notes Summary - June 2025
## 1. **Team Process Insights (Lessons Learned)**

*   **Strong participation**: Everyone contributed to presentations; not just two people talking for the group. This was a strength and boosted engagement.
*   **Areas to improve:**
    *   More **cross-functional input** (e.g., more voices in the financials, more feedback on each other's sections).
    *   **Full rehearsal** before presentations to improve flow and timing.
    *   **Consistency in formatting** and slide style—look at other teams' decks for inspiration on design and "punchiness."
    *   Slides should stand **alone** as client deliverables—must be clear without a presenter.
    *   **Deeper analysis and framework use**: Go beyond verbatim client input; use established frameworks to add strategic value.
    *   More **collaboration outside meetings**; don't just submit work to the lead or project manager—share with the whole team for input.

## 2. **Client/Stakeholder Dynamics**

*   HOTH (client) is **passionate but unfocused** in meetings—tends to go off on tangents.
*   Meetings are **time-limited** and it's hard to cover all needed questions.
*   Possible solution: **Assign a timekeeper** for meetings, or send targeted questions in advance to keep things on track.
*   HOTH's **main value**: Personalized, community-oriented care, run by people with lived experience.
*   They're considering a **name change** ("Home on the Hill" may not fit future branding).
*   Data/metrics tracking is limited—consider recommending simple tools to track outcomes.

---

## 3. **Key Strategic Gaps and Needs**

*   **Branding is unclear**—HOTH isn't sure how to position or describe itself. There's an identity/branding gap.
*   Need to **highlight unique value proposition** (personalized care, lived experience, community focus).
*   Should **compare HOTH to peers/competitors** (even outside Canada, if relevant, e.g., U.S. mental health housing).
*   **Case studies** (e.g., "Tom's story") are valuable but need to be generalized and supported with data where possible.

---

## 4. **Actionable Recommendations for Marketing Planning**

*   **Clarify and document the value proposition**—distill HOTH’s real-world impact and what differentiates it.
*   **Map the competitive landscape** (local/provincial/national), focusing on funding, services, and outcomes.
*   Build **standalone slide decks** and written materials—ensure all outputs are client-ready with minimal explanation.
*   Use **client anecdotes as hooks**, but back them up with structured data and strategic messaging.
*   Push HOTH to define **target audience(s)** for marketing—donors, partners, families, government?
*   Propose **quick-win recommendations** (e.g., improved metrics tracking, testimonial collection, easy rebranding wins).

---

## 5. **Operational Learnings for Team**

*   Keep all meeting notes in a **central shared folder** for transparency.
*   Assign clear **roles** for each workstream (e.g., marketing, financials, case studies).
*   Continue to **share work-in-progress** with the whole team, not just project leads.
*   Consider **short, focused team check-ins** outside the main meeting for feedback and brainstorming.
