# Value Proposition & Differentiators

*   **Family-Centric, Holistic Care**: HOH's core promise is a "caring, stable long-term home environment" for adults with serious mental illness, coupled with parallel support for their families 1. It combines affordable supportive housing with life-skills, recreation/education programs (art/music therapy, peer support) and a dedicated family support group (drop-in peer meetings, caregiver education and advocacy) 2. This family model of care "extends the 'circle of care'" by actively engaging families of clients 3. In practice this means providing individualized housing plus personalized caregiver support (counseling, resources, education). This integrated approach (housing and family services) is unique in the local system 4 1.

*   **Signature Programs**: HOH's Robert Veltheer Lecture Series is a distinctive outreach/education platform - expert talks on schizophrenia, bipolar, wellness held ~4x/year 5. Community feedback highlights the lectures (plus recreation/art activities) as especially valued 6. HOH also offers a **WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan)** program for clients and other specialized workshops (noted internally), reinforcing its branding as a community education hub.

*   **Emotional Impact & Storytelling**: The organization is known for its passionate founding story and for humanizing care through storytelling. A recent consultant review noted that HOH's “passionate founding story” and holistic support resonate strongly, building a “supportive community around families" 4. Testimonials and family success stories are key messaging pillars (e.g. "Before Home on the Hill, I felt alone...now I have hope") - a narrative HOH will emphasize in fundraising and outreach.

# Survey & Focus-Group Insights

*   **Highly Engaged, Satisfied Audience**: Across client, caregiver, and professional respondents, HOH received **very high satisfaction ratings**. Surveys showed most would “recommend HOH" to others, indicating strong trust and loyalty 7. In fact, HOH's lecture series was identified as a favorite program, and overall "very high rating to HOH" was a key finding 8.

*   **What They Value**: Feedback consistently highlights the family support group, recreational/therapy activities, and lecture series as HOH's most valued offerings 9. Caregivers praise the safe, confidential support group (in-person and virtual) and expert speaker events 10. Clients appreciate the social connections and life-skills built in recreational therapy (e.g. art, music, outings) - one report notes clients in the rec program are developing lasting friendships and even part-time jobs 11. Professionals (e.g. therapists, police, educators) on HOH's volunteer roster are very experienced 12, and they value HOH's evidence-based model and measurable impact.

*   **Engagement Channels**: The primary referral channel is word-of-mouth. Survey takers overwhelmingly first heard of HOH through friends, family, or other community contacts 13. Other common touchpoints include local health workers, schools, or community centers. HOH's existing channels (Facebook, Twitter, website) have moderate reach, but attendees often come to HOH events via personal networks 13 14. This suggests messaging is most effective when shared peer-to-peer or through trusted community partners (hospitals, churches, social service agencies).

# Audience Segmentation

*   **Family Caregivers (primarily seniors)**: Most caregivers in HOH's groups are older adults (often parents/grandparents) 15. They seek emotional support, practical guidance, and respite. Messaging for this group should emphasize hope and belonging: e.g. "You're not alone, a community understands your journey." Programs like the Family Support Group and caregiver workshops (on navigation, self-care) resonate strongly. Key content: personal caregiver stories, educational resources, and invitations to peer support meetings.

*   **Clients (young adults with serious MI)**: HOH's client base is mainly young adults (often with schizophrenia, bipolar, etc) 15. They benefit from stable housing and engaging activities. Their families noted that socializing is "a key element to staying mentally healthy" 11. Messaging here focuses on independence and community: e.g. "Build life skills and friendships in a caring home." Visuals of peers enjoying art/music groups or testimonials from clients (with consent) can illustrate success (e.g. finding work, forming friendships).

*   **Healthcare & Social Service Professionals**: The organization also serves local health workers, social workers, police, etc - many with decades of experience 12. They value HOH's credible, integrated approach and its collaborative referrals. Messaging to professionals should highlight HOH's outcomes and evidence (e.g. reduced hospital readmissions, community integration) and its niche role ("we fill gaps where the system leaves off" 3). Outreach to this group is best done through formal channels (professional associations, hospital networks) emphasizing partnership and training opportunities (e.g. inviting them to speak at lectures).

*   **Donors & Funders**: Although not directly surveyed, HOH's funders include Bingo revenues (local seniors), foundations (Trillium, United Way, Red Cross), and individual donors (often family members of clients). These stakeholders look for impact and sustainability. Messaging should underscore HOH's cost-effective model and community impact (e.g. “one $ donation provides X months of housing"). The 2023 Annual Report thanked donors publicly 16. Using concise infographics (e.g. number of clients housed, lectures held) and high-trust channels (CanadaHelps, local media) will help engage this segment.

# Financial Context

*   **Budget & Revenues**: HOH is very lean. As of 2018, its operating budget was only ~\$20K/year 17 (since grown with additional staff). Key revenue streams remain Bingo proceeds (from renting housing space), core government/community grants (Ontario Trillium Foundation, United Way, Red Cross) and occasional crowdfunding drives 18 19 "Primary funding sources include Bingo... Trillium grants, and community-based crowdfunding” 18.

*   **Trends & Pressures**: In recent years HOH expanded its programs (new office hub, hires) thanks to one-time grants, which has created a funding gap. They face a **\$60K shortfall** in the next 12 months if trends continue 20 21. Historical financials show expenditures spiking year-over-year (largely from salaries for new staff) 22. Without more diverse revenue (beyond Bingo/grants), HOH risks running deficits. The Statement of Work explicitly notes HOH "is facing a financial crisis... trying to raise \$CAD 60,000 over the next 12 months to maintain the current level of activity" 21.

*   **Budget Priorities**: Current funds are prioritized for maintaining housing sites (a 4-bed group home plus independent apt) and core programs at no cost to clients 18. New grants are being channeled toward staffing (e.g. hiring a fundraiser and program coordinator in 2023 23). Bingo funds largely pay for program salaries. Capital expenses (e.g. building a new house) are secondary to keeping doors open.

# Operational Context

*   **Staff & Volunteers**: HOH has a very small paid team: an Executive Director (part-time), a full-time Recreation Therapist (hired recently) and a cook (part-time) at the group home 24 25. (New hires in 2023 included a **program coordinator**, an accreditation specialist, and a fundraiser 23 26.) All other roles (family group moderator, art instructor, governance) are volunteer-driven. Board leadership is hands-on (even filing advocacy complaints 27), but the 2018 playbook noted some "lack of alignment" among board members.

*   **Facilities & Programs**: In 2023 HOH consolidated programs into one "**Community Hub**" at 10825 Yonge St (Suite 201) 23, which houses the office, drop-in centre and program space. Their supportive housing includes one apartment (Richmond Hill Community Hub) and "The Manse" house (5 residents) 28. Recreational programs serve ~20 clients weekly 11. A recent internal update notes: "we have a group home that houses 4 clients and 2 part-time cooks... We are still having issues with getting more clients so it is good timing for your marketing strategy" 25. Thus, **client recruitment is a challenge** - many interested caregivers come to the lecture series, but their relatives live outside Richmond Hill 29 and can't access HOH's local services.

*   **Partnerships & Ecosystem**: HOH actively partners with local health and community organizations. The lecture series has catalyzed ties with hospitals (Markham-Stouffville, Ontario Shores) 5, and HOH is listed in regional databases (211 Ontario). The 2018 playbook enumerated 100+ potential York Region partners (CMHA York, LOFT/Crosslinks, Alzheimer Society, etc). HOH's niche is emphasized: unlike larger agencies, HOH offers a **family/home model**. It also seeks referrals from hospitals, police, churches and community health centres.

*   **Infrastructure Gaps**: Key gaps are limited housing capacity (only 6 beds currently) and no in-house fundraising/marketing staff. HOH's volunteer-heavy model means board/volunteers also handle outreach and advocacy, which can be inconsistent. They are investing in organizational infrastructure: formalizing policies/procedures and accreditation, and installing better data systems 30 18, but the small staff means scalability is slow.

# Branding & Reputation

*   **Perception**: Among those who know HOH, reputation is excellent (participants rate it highly 7). Its **family-support focus** is well understood by stakeholders. However, public awareness in the broader GTA is very low 31 32. The SWAT analysis notes HOH "isn't a household name in the broader GTA" 31, which limits new donor referrals.

*   **Name & Messaging**: The brand "Home on the Hill" evokes a safe home, and there's no current push to rebrand. Messaging pivots on warmth and dignity ("Home", "family", "hope") combined with professionalism (mental health expertise). Draft messaging emphasizes HOH's unique **value-add** - stable housing plus caregiver care 1 and its track record of impact.

*   **Channels**: Current marketing is mostly earned/organic: social media and word-of-mouth. HOH's website (homeonthehillsupportivehousing.com) lists programs and lectures, and a moderate follower base on Facebook shares tips and HOH news 14. Twitter/X is used for mental health advocacy, and LinkedIn profiles the team and services 14. They also post recorded lectures on YouTube. No paid advertising is used - instead HOH relies on community posts (211 Ontario, CanadaHelps) and events 33. This limits reach; one strategy is to grow storytelling on social channels and local media coverage.

# Competitive & Peer Comparison

*   **Local Peers**: In York Region, organizations like LOFT/Crosslinks, Blue Door Shelters, and Belinda's Place offer housing/support services. CMHA York and Ontario Shores provide programming at a larger scale. Unlike these, HOH's key differentiation is its **family-inclusive housing model**. For example, LOFT runs a broader supportive housing program (with no family involvement component), whereas HOH integrates caregiver support groups with housing. In short, HOH competes less on service breadth and more on niche focus.

*   **Service Gaps**: Most peers do not offer the full suite HOH does (e.g. few have both a family support group and in-house recreational therapy). The competitive analysis spreadsheet confirms HOH is among the few with an explicit family/caregiver support focus. Conversely, HOH lacks some peer services (e.g. day programs for youth, addiction services) which larger agencies offer. The competitive threat is mainly financial: larger non-profits and foundations compete for the same grants/donations 34. HOH's strategy is to partner rather than duplicate: e.g. referring clients to Ontario Shores or CMHA when needs exceed its scope, and co-hosting caregiver workshops with the Ontario Caregiver Organization 35.

*   **Opportunities vs. Gaps**: HOH has a chance to stand out by formally benchmarking against models like Allied Home (a similar non-profit) and by learning best practices (the SOW calls for this comparative analysis 36). For example, HOH could consider social enterprise ideas (selling art from workshops, etc.) or corporate sponsorship of specific programs (suggested by consultants 37). Currently, aside from housing, HOH's programs fill unique gaps (no other local group offers family advocacy alongside housing), which can be emphasized in fundraising and PR.

# Strategic Goals & Objectives

*   **Short-Term (1-2 years)**: Complete the Community Hub at 10825 Yonge St. (all programs under one roof) and stabilize programming there 23. Execute the newly-developed fundraising plan: raise the \$60K gap via donors, events, and new grants 20 26. Formalize policies and track outcomes (as noted in the 2023 annual report) to meet accreditation and grant criteria 30. Expand proven programs: maintain lecture frequency (now ~4/yr) and increase recreational events (peer support group, art classes) to capitalize on their high impact 4 38.

*   **Mid/Long-Term (3-5 years)**: Grow capacity and impact. Plan for additional housing units - the 2023 report mentions discussions with government for more supportive housing 39. Potentially replicate the caregiver support model in nearby communities (train volunteer facilitators) 40. Diversify revenue: build individual donor base (with better storytelling), and explore social enterprise or sponsorship (e.g. corporate funding for lecture series) 41. Strengthen partnerships: aim for formal referral agreements with hospitals and family services, leveraging the strong relationships from HOH's lecture series and advocacy.

*   **Mission Alignment**: All objectives emphasize HOH's mission: sustaining “a bright future" for families of those with mental illness 42. As the strategic plan states, HOH seeks long-term sustainability by “better communication of the value proposition” to ensure ongoing funding 43. The ultimate goal is to cement HOH as the trusted community hub for serious mental illness care in York Region - known for its compassionate "home" model and family focus.
