| **Ontario Trillium Foundation - Grow Grants** [1, 2] | Registered Ontario nonprofits (or multi-org collaboratives) running established programs. Focus: scale/expand proven services (e.g., mental-health support, caregiver programs). | $100K-$600K total over 2-3 years (~$50K-$200K/year) [2]. Multi-year funding. | Next cycle: Oct 8-Nov 5, 2025 [3]. Apply online at OTF website. | **Fit:** Ideal for scaling existing HOH programs (e.g., caregiver support, lecture series). HOH has strong track record in family support (R. Veltheer series) [4]. **Capacity:** Requires reporting/eval over multiple years (HOH is small: "2-10 employees" [5]). **Competitors:** Many ON mental-health orgs (e.g., CMHA chapters, crisis centres) pursue OTF. OTF allows collaborative applications [1] - HOH could partner (e.g., with CMHA York or Ontario Shores) on proposals. |
| **Ontario Trillium Foundation - Seed Grants** [6]    | Ontario registered nonprofits or collaboratives planning new or pilot projects. Focus: build capacity, new programs (e.g., launch a support group or training).              | $10K-$100K single-year (6-12 month) [6].                                     | Next cycle: July 23-Aug 20, 2025 [6].                       | **Fit:** Good for piloting new HOH services (e.g., expanding WRAP, new peer support initiative). **Capacity:** One-year grant, less onerous reporting than Grow, but still requires capacity. **Competitors:** Broad; but collaboratives allowed, so co-apps (e.g., with OCO or local caregivers network) could strengthen application.                                                                                               |
| **Ontario Trillium Foundation - Capital Grants** [7] | Ontario nonprofits for facility upgrades (buildings, equipment). Focus: improving spaces where community services are delivered.                                            | $10K-$200K single-year [7]. Capital (one-time) funds.                        | Next cycle: Feb 5-Mar 5, 2025 [7].                          | **Fit:** Could fund improvements at HOH housing or HOTH Centre (e.g., accessibility, therapy equipment). **Capacity:** Capital projects need project management (HOH has experience with housing). **Competitors:** High - many orgs seek facility funds. Possibly partner with municipal govt or other charity (e.g., as landlord or co-applicant) for joint projects.                                                                        |
| **Petro-Canada CareMakers Foundation - Local Grants** [8, 9] | Canadian registered charities supporting family caregivers locally. Focus: basic caregiver supports (e.g., respite, transportation, workshops).                    | $7,500 (one-year award) [8] (no multi-year extension).                        | Annual cycle: portal opens early Sept (e.g., Sept 5-Oct 17, 2025) [9, 10]. | **Fit:** Directly matches HOH's caregiver peer-support activities. Can supplement caregiver support programs (respite or group costs). **Capacity:** Low; very small award but easy to manage. **Competitors:** Other caregiver groups apply (e.g., Alzheimer, autism charities). However, niche focus on caregivers of mentally ill may give HOH edge. Co-app not allowed (single org).                                                             |
| **Ontario Caregiver Organization - FSN Capacity Grants** [11] | Ontario "Family Support Networks" (FSNs) – peer groups of caregivers supporting adults with developmental disabilities. Also orgs supporting FSNs.                      | $1,000-$4,500 (single year) [11].                                            | Annual call (2025 closed on Mar 14, likely similar mid-March each year) [11, 12]. | **Fit:** HOH is not strictly an FSN (serves mental illness, not developmental disabilities), but could partner with an existing FSN (or help form one for mental illness caregivers) to apply. **Capacity:** Very small grant for group capacity-building (e.g., training for support facilitators). **Co-apply:** HOH could coordinate with a disability FSN or community living group for joint FSN proposal. Many FSNs across ON receive such grants. |
| **Bell Let's Talk Community Mental Health Fund** [13] | Canadian registered charities/qualified donees serving mental health needs. Focus: scaling proven mental-health services to improve access.                              | Grants up to $25,000 (annual program) [13].                                  | Annual call (typically late winter/spring; 2024 closed by Jun 2025). Next details TBA. | **Fit:** Perfect match! HOH is a CRA charity addressing community mental health. Could fund caregiver workshops or outreach. **Capacity:** Requires evidence of impact. Many charities nationwide compete (focused on scaling "proven" programs). **Competitors:** Large and small mental-health groups; collaboration unlikely (single-app). HOH's niche caregiver focus could distinguish its application.                                |
| **City of Richmond Hill - Community & Cultural Grants** [14, 15] | Richmond Hill nonprofits or artists delivering community programs (e.g., health, recreation, cultural events) benefiting RH residents.                              | Up to $5,000 per project (≤50% of project cost) [14].                        | Annual cycle - typically applications due in early spring (2025 deadline Apr 13) [15]. | **Fit:** HOH's local programs (lectures, workshops, drop-in support) qualify as community projects. Helps cover events or group activities. **Capacity:** Small grant (no heavy reporting), easy fit. **Competitors:** Any RH community org (including HOH itself if applicable). Useful for bridging funding gaps; co-app not applicable (single applicant grants).                                                                      |
| **(Additional\*) York Region Community Investment Fund** | York Region-funded projects by nonprofits addressing service gaps in human services (health, housing, youth, etc.).                                                     | Varies by project (see region's funded grant announcements).                 | Annual or project-based; applications announced via York websites. | **Fit:** HOH's work (supportive housing, family support) aligns with York Region priorities in mental health and housing. Past grants to CMHA-York, Carefirst, Hong Fook, etc. [16, 17]. Suggest monitoring York Region calls and partnering with similar agencies for joint proposals. (No direct citation for this line; refer York Region site.)                                                                                               |

**Notes:** All links above are sources detailing the program. HOH is a small charity (2-10 staff/volunteers [5]), so larger multi-year grants (e.g., OTF Grow) will require strong project management and evaluation capacity. Many opportunities encourage collaboration: OTF Grow/Seed allow multi-org applications [1]. Competitor organizations abound locally (e.g., CMHA York & South Simcoe, Carefirst, Hong Fook, Family Services, etc., which have won York grants [16, 17]), so unique fit and partnerships (e.g., with hospitals or caregiver networks) can strengthen HOH's bids.

# Corporate / Community Partners (Ontario)

| Partner / Sponsor                          | Focus & Eligibility                                           | Support Type & Scale    | Notes / Fit (potential involvement)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ontario Shores Centre (WH)**             | Public mental-health hospital (Whitby).                       | Collaboration, sponsorship | Major regional mental-health leader. Potential collaborator for research, co-hosted events, or referrals. (E.g., Ontario Shores ran social-enterprise calls to employ clients [18].) Partnering could boost credibility or open funding channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Ontario Caregiver Organization (OCO)**   | Provincial caregiver agency (funded by government).           | Program partnerships    | Aligns with HOH's caregiver mandate. OCO offers resources and network (though limited grants). Could partner on joint workshops or networks; co-app for caregiver grants (e.g., FSN grants) if HOH expands scope to DD caregiver support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Canadian Mental Health Assoc. (York Region)** | Local CMHA branch.                                            | Collaboration, referrals, funding | Umbrella mental-health charity. May co-fund joint initiatives (e.g., family support groups) or share events. CMHA won local York grants [16]. HOH could collaborate on projects to access regional funding (York Region's prioritized mental-health initiatives).                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Bell Canada (Let's Talk)**               | Corporate (telecom) with mental health CSR focus.             | Sponsorship, grants (Let's Talk Fund) | Bell's Let's Talk campaign offers funding (covered above) and large-scale awareness. Possibility for event sponsorship or employee volunteering. HOH could apply to Bell's Community Fund (covers mental-health programming up to $25K) [13].                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Telus (Friendly Future Foundation)**     | Telecom (youth/education focus).                              | Community grants (~$10-20K) | Telus Community Boards fund youth-focused health/education projects [19]. HOH's adult programs fall outside Telus youth remit, but HOH could engage Telus through employee volunteer programs or tech donations (Telus offers discounts/grants for charities).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Sun Life Financial**                     | Insurer with health philanthropy.                             | Foundation grants       | Sun Life funds community health initiatives (e.g., Health Access Hero awards). HOH could pursue Sun Life community grants (typically $5K-$25K). Also potential sponsor for events. Alignment: HOH's mental-health mission supports Sun Life's employee mental-wellness focus.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Local Businesses (e.g., branches of banks, retailers)** | Community sponsors (e.g., RBC, Home Depot).                   | Sponsorships, in-kind donations | Many local branches support charities annually. E.g., RBC branches, Costco, supermarkets often contribute to health nonprofits. HOH can cultivate RH business community for event sponsorships or match-funding drives (e.g., TD/Petro-Canada programs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Community Foundations (York/RH-Markham)** | Regional philanthropies.                                      | Grants, endowments      | E.g., Richmond Hill/Markham Community Foundation. They issue grant calls (often spring) for community health projects ($5K-$20K). HOH should apply when themes align (e.g., mental-health/community support). Foundations may also provide one-on-one fundraising advice.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Family Alliance Ontario**                | Advocacy for families with disabilities.                      | Collaboration, networks | Provincial caregiver network. HOH could partner to amplify advocacy, co-host education for families. Could access Family Alliance's stakeholder networks for outreach, and jointly apply for family-support grants (OCO FSN, OTF Family stream).                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **York Region Health Services**            | Municipal health initiatives (Community & Health Svcs).       | Local grants, program referrals | York Region invests in mental-health housing and services (see recent $ initiatives). While direct public grants may go to hospitals or CMHA, HOH could partner with region (e.g., volunteer integration) and stay alert to new RFPs for supportive-housing funding.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Local Hospitals (MSH, UHN)**             | Markham Stouffville, etc. for mental-health.                  | Partnerships, sponsorships | Hospitals often sponsor community lecture series or caregiver resources. HOH already partners on events (e.g., joint lectures) [20]. Strengthening ties could unlock joint grants or corporate donors via hospital foundations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Notes:** Each partner here represents a potential funding source or collaborator rather than a grant program. Engagement ranges from seeking sponsorship/awards to co-delivering projects. For example, HOH's lecture series (Robert Veltheer events) could attract sponsors like Ontario Shores or local businesses, while caregiver support programs align with OCO or CMHA family initiatives. Note: Bell's Let's Talk Fund was detailed above as a grant. Telus offers technology grants and discounts that HOH could leverage (contacts, [59+L69-L72]). Overall, a combined strategy of applying to grant programs and cultivating these partners (and exploring collaborative applications) will strengthen HOH's funding plan.
