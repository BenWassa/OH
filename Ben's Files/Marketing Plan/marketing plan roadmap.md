# Marketing Plan Roadmap

## Timeline
The project follows a phased timeline running through August 2025, with the final marketing plan due at the end of August [1, 2].
*   **Phase 1 (May)**: Data gathering and clarification of HOTH's mission.
*   **Phase 2 (June)**: Financial analysis.
*   **Phase 3 (July)**: Collection of funder insights and refinement of messaging.
*   **Phase 4 (August)**: Synthesis of findings into final recommendations and deliverables [1].

We should immediately begin Phase 2/3 work (data analysis, stakeholder interviews, and draft messaging) to stay on track. Each phase should produce interim outputs (e.g., stakeholder summaries, draft value propositions) feeding into the final marketing plan by August.

## Key Priorities & Value Proposition
Home on the Hill's core mission is to provide stable, supportive housing and life-skills programs for individuals with severe mental illness and their families [3]. The plan must emphasize maintaining engagement in peer support groups and family/caregiver programs as the foremost priority. For example, HOTH â€œprovides a caring and stable long-term home environment" plus support services and family support programs [3]. Other activities (like optional workshops or fundraising events) are secondary to sustaining these core services. Importantly, HOTH offers all services at no cost [4], so the marketing message should highlight this family-focused, barrier-free model. The plan also needs to address financial sustainability: HOTH's primary revenues (rental bingo proceeds, Trillium grants and community crowdfunding) are currently insufficient for long-term stability [4, 5]. Grant fundraising and Bingo revenue campaigns should therefore be integral to the plan, ensuring funding pipelines to "keep the purse from emptying." In summary, our messaging and strategies will underscore HOTH's unique value (long-term stable care, individualized therapy, family support) while supporting new donor engagement for grants and bingo funds [4, 5].

## Team & Resources
HOTH is largely volunteer-run: apart from a few paid staff (Executive Director, recreational therapist, cook), all other roles are held by volunteers [4]. Our marketing team also consists of Endeavour volunteers with diverse professional backgrounds (including consulting and corporate experience). We should leverage this by assigning tasks matched to each volunteer's skills (e.g., digital marketing, stakeholder outreach, financial analysis). We have access to past financial reports and any existing marketing materials for planning purposes, but we won't invest time in new market research beyond those records [1, 4]. In short, we will treat client finances and past documents as key inputs and focus our volunteer resources on crafting the strategy itself.

## Roadmap Structure
We will build a clear, month-by-month outline to guide creation of the final marketing plan. The final deliverable will include a phased marketing action plan covering short-, medium-, and long-term activities [6]. For example, the plan might break into 0-3 months, 3-6 months, and 6-12 months phases, each with prioritized tasks (e.g., finalize messaging, launch social campaigns, apply for specific grants) [6]. Key components of the roadmap will be: defining target audiences (families, donors, community partners), crafting core messaging (based on HOTH's value proposition), and choosing channels (social media, email, local events) that engage those audiences. We should use available templates and best practices for nonprofits but customize them to fit HOTH's situation. Each roadmap phase should note resource needs (volunteer-hours, estimated budgets) and expected outcomes (e.g., increase in grant applications or community engagement). The final report will include these phased recommendations along with cash-flow implications and prioritization of tactics [6, 7].

## Action Items (Next Steps)
*   Review existing materials (SOW, finances, membership data) and finalize the value proposition and messaging framework [6, 8].
*   Assign volunteer team members to tasks (data analysis, grant research, content creation) based on their expertise.
*   Set internal milestones (e.g., first draft messaging by early July, outreach plan by mid-July) aligned with the phases above.
*   Prepare an outline/template for the final marketing plan that includes the phased action plan and links each strategy to HOTH's funding goals [6].
*   Schedule weekly check-ins to track progress against the August deadline.

By following this timeline and focusing on HOTH's core mission and funding needs, we'll build a marketing plan that maintains client and family engagement while securing the grants and revenue HOTH needs for sustainability [4, 6].
