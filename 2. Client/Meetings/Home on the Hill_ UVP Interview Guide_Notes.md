## **Phase 1: Warm-Up & Personal Connection (10-15 minutes)**

*Goal: Create comfort, establish emotional baseline, understand personal
investment*

### **Opening Questions**

1.  **[\"Tell me your story with HOTH---how did you first get
    involved?\"]{.mark}**

    -   Listen for: Origin story, initial motivations, personal journey

    -   Lesley: help with the artwork (clients have limited skills);
        depends on their illness; more ill some times than others which
        impacts their artwork e.g., teaching someone how to mix paints;
        let them work freely

    -   Caregivers is a more advanced program and are given more
        advanced things to do; like the group for laughing and making
        jokes and talking loudly; very animated; way for them to get
        away from their reality

    -   Lesley is a volunteer and runs two art programs

    -   A client was super depressed and isolated without any
        connections to any friends, was living with parents and severely
        mentally ill brother. This affected Tom, who was introduced to
        other clients and involving him in the community through Muay
        Thai, going on walks. Got him back into life, more engaged.
        Couldn't handle work at all; too anxious; in a dark place; now
        he's working full-time; moved out of his parents house.
        Connected to his Jewish community.

> music program very successful, great turnout; lots of instruments;
> great for people who aren't as social; feel isolated; connect with
> others who have gone through similar experiences
>
> every week is different people; varying levels of engagement due to
> different schedules
>
> 6 in caregivers; 6 in art program for clients as well
>
> 22 clients; 20 in person caregivers; 100 online through lecture
> series; lunch and dinners; afternoon programs (6-10 people)
>

> their kids are doing
>
> Maggie: founding board: unhappy with services in Richmond Hill; only
> craftsmen centre who weren't interactive and didn't develop
> friendships so started with education nights where we had speakers and
> family caregivers; grew from there; still focus on family caregivers;
> if family isn't feeling strong and supported, they won't feel
> supported; let's support the caregiver and then if housing comes up,
> that was the last piece that came together. We are unique because we
> care and have lived experience.

2.  **\"What do you personally enjoy most about being part of HOTH?\"**

    -   Listen for: Energy, passion points, emotional language

### **Emotional Temperature Check**

-   **\"When you tell friends or family about HOTH, what do you find
    yourself saying?\"**

    -   Listen for: Natural language, enthusiasm, key talking points

-   **What do you believe is HOTH's unique contribution to the lives of
    individuals with schizophrenia and their families, especially in
    light of the recent challenges (loss of housing, funding shifts,
    leadership changes)?**

-   **Julia:** here's the caregiver and client support; our name is
    confusing because people think we are housing; we really understand
    mental illness bc we live with it; we know what works and what makes
    things worse; socialization and meaningful engagement; find what
    means something; talk to them as a person not an iillness; how to
    feel better and avoid things that will make them feel worse; gives
    us validity

-   **Lesley:** letter from a mother;

-   

## **Phase 2: Exploratory Experiences & Observations (20-25 minutes)**

*Goal: Dive deeper into specific experiences, outcomes, and
differentiators*

### **Client & Community Impact**

3.  **[\"Can you share a story about a time HOTH really made a
    difference for someone?\"]{.mark}**

    -   Follow-up: \"What made that possible? What was unique about how
        HOTH handled it?\"

    -   Listen for: Specific outcomes, process details, emotional impact

\* craftsmen centre deals with drug addiction, homeless; opioid, serious
drug addictions; drop-in centre

our people are still living with their families, not as much drug
involvement; we care; we establish relationships; talk to them about
what's important; try to move them to the next step up; strong community
connections with the people; give them variety; out and about in the
community

Rob: family run vs professionally run; caregivers have lived
experiences; more personal approach to helping people overcome
challenges;

Recreation other places are drop-in and run by hospitals; rigid
standardized programs whereas I tailor it specifically for each person;
get to know our clients better because they are here for longer time vs
outpatient programs at hospitals;

Group home guys are 5 years -- have been here since 2018

Facing the problem that parents are getting older -- don't know what
will happen when they pass away; most services only treat up to age 26
for psychosis; shortage of housing; this is why many are on the streets;
don't know what will happen to their children; clients would be a lot
sicker if they didn't come out to programs

other orgs also believe in medication

4.  Can you share a specific example where Home on the Hill made a
    meaningful difference in a client's or family\'s life ---
    particularly in ways measurable through improved quality of life,
    housing stability, reduced hospital readmission, social integration,
    or family caregiver well-being --- that you believe may not have
    occurred with other service providers?\"

    -   I think it overlaps a bit 4 and 6 but in general I am interested
        in trying to gauge the quantifiable impact.

5.  **\"If you had to describe HOTH's greatest success story to a
    potential funder or partner, what would it be---and why does that
    story matter?"**

6.  **"How have the needs of your clients (individuals with
    schizophrenia, caregivers) evolved over time, and how might HOTH's
    programs need to evolve to stay relevant?"**

> **\*** clients start to trust you; paranoia; have to trust you; its
> not that needs change, the trust in us changes
>
> people with mental illness don't want to associate with others with
> mental iillness; do 1:1

### **Competitive Differentiation**

7.  **\"In the York Region, there are other mental health organizations.
    What sets HOTH apart?\"**

    -   Follow-up: \"What can HOTH do that others can\'t or don\'t?\"

    -   Listen for: Unique capabilities, approach differences,
        competitive advantages

8.  **\"If HOTH stopped their services tomorrow, what would be lost that
    couldn\'t be replaced?\"**

    -   Listen for: Irreplaceable elements, core essence, critical
        functions

9.  **What do you think funders, partners, and the broader community
    misunderstand or overlook about HOTH's role---and how could we
    clarify that message?**

### **Organizational Culture & Approach**

10. **\"How does HOTH approach challenges differently than other
    organizations you\'ve been part of?\"**

    -   Listen for: Methodology, philosophy, problem-solving style

## **Phase 3: Synthesis & UVP Framing (10-15 minutes)**

*Goal: Crystallize insights into concrete value proposition language*

### **Direct UVP Articulation**

11. **["If you were talking to a potential donor about why they should
    choose to fund HOTH, how would you explain HOTH's unique
    strengths?"]{.mark}**

    -   Listen for: Compelling case, unique benefits, impact statements

\* focus on clients and the caregivers

usually tell a success story in the grant; different for every person;
tailored to the individual;

clients are both the caregivers and the individuals

misconceptions around the word client

don't call them patients because that is derogatory

12. **\"If you could only use one sentence to capture what makes HOTH
    special, what would it be?\"**

    -   Listen for: Essence distillation, core message, authentic
        language

### **Future Vision**

14. **\"If HOTH could secure sustainable funding, what one or two
    programs or services would you prioritize as essential to HOTH's
    mission---and why are those worth investing in?**

## **Closing & Reflection (5 minutes)**

15. **\"Is there anything important about HOTH\'s value that we haven\'t
    touched on?\"**

16. **\"What questions should I be asking that I haven\'t asked?\"**
