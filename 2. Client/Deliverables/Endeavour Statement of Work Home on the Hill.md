# Executive Summary

Home on the Hill (HOTH) was founded in 2011 by a group of families who
saw firsthand the lack of long-term housing and support for loved ones
living with severe mental illness. Motivated by personal experience and
a strong sense of community, they came together to create a stable,
caring environment where individuals could live with dignity and
support. Today, HOTH offers housing, life skills programs, and caregiver
resources at no cost to ensure that those who need help the most can
access it without barriers.

HOTH is currently facing a financial crisis following an expansion
enabled by one-time grants. With a projected funding gap of \$60,000
over the next year, the organization is seeking to stabilize operations
and build a sustainable future. Its revenue streams (primarily Bingo
proceeds, Trillium grants, and crowdfunding) are insufficient to support
long-term planning. Compounding this issue is a lack of financial
oversight tools and internal marketing capacity needed to attract new
donors or funding partners.

Endeavour Consulting is partnering with HOTH to deliver a marketing plan
focused on sustainability. The engagement will involve assessing the
organization's current financial position, fleshing out the value
proposition, and developing a marketing plan to help HOTH become more
competitive in seeking financial resources. The project will also
clarify HOTH's value proposition and develop messaging that appeals to
funders, donors, and the broader public.

Over five phases, the project will deliver actionable recommendations
and a phased roadmap. These will include target audience strategies,
marketing recommendations, and an analysis of similar nonprofit models.
While direct implementation support (e.g., content development or grant
writing) is outside the scope, the engagement will build a strong
foundation to help HOTH align its mission with achievable, sustainable
outcomes.

#  **Background**

Home on the Hill (HOTH) is a family-founded, non-profit organization
established in 2011 to address the urgent need for affordable,
supportive long-term housing and services for individuals living with
serious mental illness. Rooted in lived experience and driven by a
community-centered approach, the organization was created by families
who recognized the gaps in long-term care and support for their loved
ones and others facing similar challenges. HOTH works with both
individuals living with mental illness and their caregivers.

Mission

-   Home on the Hill is committed to improving the quality of life for
    > individuals with severe mental illness and their families through
    > a holistic and inclusive model of care. Its mission is to:

-   Provide a caring and stable long-term home environment for persons
    > with severe mental illness.

-   Offer support services, life skills training, and programs that
    > foster recreational, educational, and social integration.

-   Support families through educational resources and emotional
    > guidance, grounded in a family model of care.

-   Promote public awareness and understanding of severe mental illness.

HOTH currently employs an executive director, a recreational therapist
and a cook, the rest are on a volunteer basis. HOTH is seeking guidance
to become financially stable and self-sustaining. The primary funding
sources for HOTH include "BINGO" funding from rental housing, Trillium
grants and community-based crowdfunding. It is important for HOTH to
continue to offer services at no cost in order to limit barriers for
individuals looking to engage with their services.

# Problem Definition

Home on the Hill is a grassroots non-profit providing supportive housing
and services for individuals with severe mental illness. HOTH expanded
operations in response to the improved funding situation and increased
one-time grants and currently is facing a financial crisis to sustain
the expanded and varied operations. They are currently trying to raise
\$CAD 60,000 over the next 12 months to maintain the current level of
activity and employees.

**Key problems include:**

-   *Single Source of Revenue Streams with Increasing Expenditures* :
    > HOTH's revenue streams are primarily driven by funding, which are
    > needed to cover various expenditures for its core operations.
    > Current funding sources---Bingo revenues, Trillium grants, and
    > crowdfunding events---are limited and insufficient for long-term
    > planning and growth. Based on historical financials over the past
    > 3 years, expenditures increased significantly year-over-year, with
    > salaries and benefits being the biggest cost driver. Initial
    > conversations with the client also indicate a lack of visibility
    > and deep understanding of the current financial situation, as well
    > as financial projections for the next 5 years.

-   *Limited Marketing Capacity and Resources to Secure Future Grants*:
    > The organization lacks the internal expertise and resources to
    > effectively capture, communicate, and market its value to attract
    > new donors, partners, and supporters. This is crucial to HOTH's
    > continuous success as revenue streams heavily rely on grants, but
    > challenges have been met in the past securing current grants.

#  Project Objectives

The Endeavour Consulting team's overall objective is to provide HOTH
with a comprehensive strategy for marketing, positioning the
organization for long-term sustainability. It enhances its ability to
secure ongoing and diverse funding sources through better communication
of the value proposition. The strategic plan will focus on aligning
HOTH's mission and vision with practical, achievable solutions,
including marketing strategies, client engagement and financial
position.

Diversifying Revenue Streams and Implementing Performance Management
Framework:

-   Assess HOTH's current financial position and identify ways to
    > monitor financial performance and enhance performance review
    > process to support decision-making

-   Evaluate existing community fundraising efforts and recommend
    > marketing strategies that can be implemented without additional
    > resources

-   Explore how partnerships could be leveraged beyond the current
    > short-term grants model (e.g., diversify revenue stream through
    > individual donor campaigns, corporate sponsorships, and social
    > enterprise opportunities)

Enhancing Client and Community Engagement:

-   Increase engagement from the community, caregivers, and potential
    > donors to ensure long-term operational sustainability.

-   Develop strategies to position HOTH as a credible and valuable
    > investment for future funding opportunities by emphasizing its
    > unique service model, including long-term, stable care and
    > individualized recreational therapy for clients with schizophrenia
    > and other severe mental health disorders.

-   Leverage existing strengths in family support and lived experience
    > to create more meaningful community outreach efforts that engage
    > potential donors, partners, and clients

-   Recommend ways to use social media platforms (e.g., Facebook,
    > Instagram, TikTok) to increase visibility and community
    > involvement, translating into potential revenue opportunities.

-   Impact metrics and storytelling points that resonate with funders
    > and partners

-   HOTH's current programs (supportive housing, recreation, and family
    > support)

    > churches)

This phase will also explore how HOTH's current position compares to
other mental health and supportive housing nonprofits.

**High-Level Financial Analysis**

be looking for. The goal is to surface insights that could help HOTH
better position itself for funding and resource partnerships. The team
will also evaluate how well HOTH communicates its differentiators and
value add to key stakeholders, including funders, partners, and the
broader public. The focus will be on the effectiveness of its current
marketing and communication assets.

This will include:

-   Identifying key characteristics and expectations of past funders
    > (e.g., Trillium Foundation, real estate board)

-   Event-based outreach strategies (e.g., speaker sessions, caregiver
    > programs)

-   Exploring reasons for grant rejections (e.g., Trillium's criteria
    > evolution)

    > model

**Phase 2 information sources:**

-   Interviews with potential and past donors (with introductions from
    > HOTH)

    > mental health (e.g., peer-led businesses)

-   Review of all available public-facing materials

-   Interviews with internal stakeholders responsible for outreach

#### Phase 3: Synthesize findings and develop actionable recommendations

Once all data and stakeholder perspectives have been gathered, the team
will synthesize insights into clear, actionable recommendations for
HOTH. These will focus on both near-term and longer-term solutions that
align with the organization's vision and capacity.

Key deliverables will include:

-   Recommendations for messaging and communication improvements
    > (marketing for improved funding diversification)

-   Identification of new target audiences and engagement strategies

-   Marketing recommendations to improve revenue stability and future
    > grant readiness

#### Phase 4: Final presentation and report

#  **About Endeavour**

Endeavour Volunteer Consulting for Non-Profits (Endeavour) is a
registered Canadian charity that provides management consulting to
improve organizational capacity and community impact. We focus on

professional consulting.

Since 2007, Endeavour has recruited and managed more than 300 volunteers
to provide management advice to more than 60 non-profit organizations in
Ontario, helping communities in many areas, such as the arts, children
and family services, disabilities, education, environment, healthcare,
immigrant services, rural development, skills training, poverty relief,
and youth development.
