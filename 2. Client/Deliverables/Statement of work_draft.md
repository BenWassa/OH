BACKGROUND

Home on the Hill (HOTH) was founded in 2011, becoming a registered
charity in 2012. Based in Richmond Hill, Ontario, it was established to
fill a critical gap in the healthcare system to support adults with
serious mental illness and their families. Specifically, they address
housing for these individuals as well as skill building, and
educational/emotional support for the individuals and caregivers alike.
HOTH is grounded in a vision of inclusive mental health care, seeing the
value of an informed and family-centred support network.

Their services are across four focus areas:

-   Supportive Housing: community-based, residential units within a
    > single house for a safe and supported living environment. This is
    > a proof-of-concept for potential long-term housing options which
    > are self-sustaining and empower the residents. This includes a
    > part-time chef to cook meals.

-   Client Services: art expression, recreational therapy (20 clients),
    > yoga, and workshops for life- and professional-skills all help to
    > encourage social interaction and aid clients in building both
    > competence and confidence.

-   Family Support: cornerstone of the support-network for clients, thus
    > also a crucial dimension of HOTH; includes caregiver groups and
    > one-on-one peer support.

-   Public Education: Their Robert Veltheer Lecture Series is held
    > quarterly, aiming to inform and destigmatize the lives and
    > experiences of the clients and families living with severe mental
    > illnesses. Also a prominent part of marketing and community
    > outreach.
