| |                                | years ago. We did not have     |   |
| |                                | staff at that time. We set up  |   |
| |                                | a tracking system for          |   |
| |                                | attendance to programs that    |   |
| |                                | Endeavor set up. We used some  |   |
| |                                | of the marketing ideas. We     |   |
| |                                | were a very small agency and   |   |
| |                                | since then we have obtained 5  |   |
| |                                | more housing units and have a  |   |
| |                                | program space that we rent. We |   |
| |                                | now also have a fulltime       |   |
