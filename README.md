# Home on the Hill (HOTH) - Endeavour Consulting Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive work for the **Home on the Hill** (HOTH) Endeavour consulting project - a 6-month strategic engagement (May-August 2025) to develop a marketing plan and organizational analysis for a nonprofit organization serving individuals with severe mental illness and their families in York Region, Ontario.

### About Home on the Hill

Founded in 2011 by families with lived experience, Home on the Hill is a grassroots nonprofit providing integrated mental health support:

- **Supportive Housing**: Stable, long-term housing for adults with serious mental illness (4-bed group home "The Manse" + independent apartments)
- **Family Support Programs**: Peer support groups, caregiver education, and advocacy services extending the "circle of care"
- **Community Education**: Robert Veltheer Lecture Series featuring expert talks on mental health (~4 events/year)
- **Recreational Therapy**: Art, music therapy, WRAP programs, and life skills development
- **Community Hub**: Consolidated program space at 10825 Yonge St, Suite 201

**Mission**: To provide a caring, stable long-term home environment while extending the "circle of care" to include families and caregivers.
