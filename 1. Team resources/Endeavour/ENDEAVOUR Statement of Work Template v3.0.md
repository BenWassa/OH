# Executive Summary

#  **Background**

Home on the Hill is a family-founded, non-profit organization
established in 2011 to address the urgent need for affordable,
supportive housing and services for individuals living with serious
mental illness. Rooted in lived experience and driven by a
community-centered approach, the organization was created by families
who recognized the gaps in long-term care and support for their loved
ones and others facing similar challenges.

Mission

-   Home on the Hill is committed to improving the quality of life for
    > individuals with severe mental illness and their families through
    > a holistic and inclusive model of care. Its mission is to:

-   Provide a caring and stable long-term home environment for persons
    > with severe mental illness.

-   Offer support services, life skills training, and programs that
    > foster recreational, educational, and social integration.

-   Support families through educational resources and emotional
    > guidance, grounded in a family model of care.

-   Promote public awareness and understanding of severe mental illness.

Currently, HOTH is seeking strategic guidance to become financially
self-sustainable. Its primary funding sources include Bingo revenues
from rental housing, grants from the Trillium Foundation, and
community-based crowdfunding events.\
