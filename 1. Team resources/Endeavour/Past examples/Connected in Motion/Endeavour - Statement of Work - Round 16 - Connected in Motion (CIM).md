2.  Background

Established in 2009, Connected in Motion (CIM) is a health-based
education group focused on fostering a community of people living with
Type 1 diabetes. CIM's aim is to create a culture of support and
engagement in diabetes self-management through peer-based experiential
diabetes education and outdoor adventure pursuits.

CIM primarily serves adults living with Type 1 diabetes as well as their
support network, which includes friends, family members, and health care
teams. CIM currently reaches more than 25,000 adults and actively
engages more than 1,000 adults per year. From 2008 to 2014, CIM engaged
more than 3,000 adults primarily between the ages of 18 and 34. In
addition, CIM also serves health care teams directly by providing
non-traditional complementary services.

CIM's core experiential diabetes activities currently consists of:

-   *Day program:* One-day events which provide opportunities for
    individuals with Type 1 diabetes to connect with the community
    through outdoor adventure and activities. This event is held around
    20 times per year.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   *Slipstream Weekends:* Multi-day, experiential education programs to
    provide skill development and the opportunity to expand comfort zone
    in relation to outdoor adventure, active living and diabetes
    self-management. There are three slipstream weekends annually held
    across Ontario, British Columbia and Nova Scotia.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   *Adventures:* Multi-day, outdoor-based activities which include
    canoe trips and backpacking series. These events are held around
    five times a year across Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   *Networking and Online Community:* CIM fosters networking among
    adults with Type 1 diabetes through day networking events and a
    connected online community.

CIM's long-term vision is to grow the size of the organization by
expanding this core programming geographically across Canada in six
specific regions: Ontario, Quebec, Maritimes, West Coast,
Midwest/Prairies, and Northern Canada; and in the United States.

CIM currently has one full time staff (executive director), one part
time staff (program coordinator), and three board members. CIM's
governance board is responsible for the organization's high-level
decision-making and has legal authority over CIM. The board consists of
a chair, treasurer, and director. In addition to governance, the board
also assists with administrative and accounting functions.

CIM's revenues consist primarily of corporate contributions from
diabetes-space sponsors, and event registration fees. CIM's multi-day
events' costs are primarily covered through these registration fees
while corporate sponsorships cover most event management and other
overhead costs.

3.  Problem Definition

We understand that after six years of successful operation primarily in
the GTA, CIM has adopted a clear long-term vision of continued growth,
to be achieved through expansion of their current program offerings
geographically across Canada, and also continued market penetration
within existing regions.

However, in order to achieve this long-term vision of growth, CIM faces
critical challenges related to strategic and business planning,
particularly with regards to fundraising. Specifically, CIM believes
that it has maximized or "tapped out" revenue derived from unreliable
corporate sponsorships in the diabetes space, and that it must pursue
other revenue sources, such as corporate sponsorships in the
non-diabetes space, in order to ensure that their future growth is
sustainable. CIM has limited resources and experience reaching into
these new potential revenue streams.

In summary, to address CIM's challenges with respect to their long-term
vision of growth, we have identified the following key factors to be
addressed as part of this engagement:

1.  The need for a strategic plan that supports CIM's stated long-term
    vision of growth

    a.  Articulation of strategic messaging for approaching sponsors

    b.  Identification of goals and targets with respect to fundraising

2.  The need to evaluate the landscape of current and potential revenue
    sources

    a.  Evaluation of current revenue sources to confirm that they have
        > been maximized

    b.  Evaluation of potential revenue sources, to determine which
        > sources are the best targets for CIM to approach

3.  The need to develop a fundraising strategy that aligns with CIM's
    strategic plan

    a.  Development of messaging for approaching sponsors who are in
        > non-Diabetes spaces

4.  Project Objectives

The principal project objectives established at the outset (in order of
priority) are:

I.  To develop a 5-year strategic plan for CIM based on the client's
    vision for future growth;

II. To evaluate available revenue streams with the intention of
    identifying the opportunities with the most potential;

III. To devise a marketing strategy for the identified high-potential
     revenue opportunities; and,

IV. To provide tactical advice on implementing the above.

In meeting these objectives, the Endeavour consulting team will work in
collaboration with CIM to evaluate the following items:

a.  **Overall Strategy:** Develop and define priorities around CIM's
    growth strategy as it pertains to expansion to new markets (e.g.
    Western Canada) and within incumbent markets (i.e. Toronto). Track
    expansion milestones and identify underlying assumptions.

b.  **Revenue Stream Assessment**

    i.  **Sponsorships/Donations:** Explore the sponsorship landscape
        > with the intent to define most promising sponsorship
        > opportunities. Currently the Consulting team has identified
        > the following sponsorship avenues: diabetes space corporate
        > sponsors, non-diabetes space corporate sponsors, personal
        > donors, government funding, and foundations.

    ii. **Earned Revenue:** Assess the potential of other possible
        > revenue streams, such as building out a full-fledged
        > membership model and selling membership data.

c.  **Marketing Strategy:** Inform the marketing strategy based on the
    above. Provide guidance on messaging and marketing channels.

d.  **Implementation Plan:** Develop tactics that would facilitate
    implementation of the strategic plan. Provide guidance on strategic
    messaging as it relates to sponsorships. Provide a set of metrics
    that will help track and evaluate project success.

5.  Project Sponsors

The Project Sponsors for this engagement will be:

1.  Current CIM leadership: Jen Hanson, Rkin, OCT, MEd (Executive
    Director)

> Jen joined CIM as the Director of Operations in 2009 and has assumed
> the role of Executive Director of the association for 2 years. Jen
> will be the primary point of contact for the engagement.
>
> 2\. EVCN Project Advisor: Richard Harbridge
>
> Refer to Section 12 for more information on the Advisor's role.

6.  Project Approach

The Endeavour team is proposing the following approach to meet the goals
of the project and deliver recommendations to Connected In Motion:

1.  Organizational Review: Reviewing all relevant internal documentation
    from CIM.

2.  Strategic Planning: Developing a high-level 5-year strategic plan.

3.  Fundraising Formative Evaluation: Assessing the current status and
    viability of CIM's existing fundraising model. (depending on outcome
    of phase 2)

4.  Fundraising Strategizing: Creating a fundraising (and if team
    capacity permit, revenue) strategy that will help CIM obtain its
    5-year objectives. (depending on outcome of phase 2)

These phases will serve as a broad guideline for the progression of the
project.

**Phase 1. Organizational Review**

In Stage 1, the engagement team will gather, read, and conduct a
preliminary analysis of all relevant international documentation related
to CIM's strategy and operations. This research will serve as a
foundations for subsequent research, analysis and synthesis activities
conducted in Stages 2, 3 and 4, including the final deliverables.

**Phase 2. Strategic Planning**

Stage 2: Strategic Planning, will consist of research, analysis, and the
development of a high-level strategic plan to guide CIM's expansion over
the next five years. The plan will also guide the development of a
fundraising strategy in Stage 4, in order to ensure that fundraising
resources are well-spent toward achieving organizational objectives. In
this way, both of these strategic documents will work together to ensure
CIM achieves its desire impact of expansion to six regions across Canada
and in the United States.

*Note: Transition to Phases 3 and 4 per the Project Approach will be
dependent on the outcomes of Phase 2, as agreed-upon between the
Endeavour team and CIM.*

**Phase 3. Fundraising Formative Evaluation and Revenue Stream
Assessment**

*Note: Progression into Phase 3 will be dependent on the outcomes of
Phase 2 and will be mutually decided upon between the Endeavour team and
CIM.*

A formative evaluation is conducted at the beginning of a project to
guide and improve the design and ensure a successful outcome. The
purpose of this stage is to holistically assess the current status and
viability of CIM's fundraising model, including its existing sponsorship
channels and earned revenue streams. This is part of our due diligence
in determining the most significant factors constraining the growth
needed to fund CIM's program expansion (see Stage 3). Activities
conducted within Stage 3 will focus on gathering and analyzing the
necessary data to make an in-depth evaluation of CIM's model---including
areas of high and low performance, and those where more data is needed.
In particular, it will include research into diabetes-related
corporations to fully determine what extra space may be available for
CIM to pursue additional sponsorship within the sector. The outcomes of
Stage 3 will support an informed research plan under Stage 4, ensuring
that the final fundraising model recommended is evidence-based and
well-tailored to CIM's needs and industry trends.

**Phase 4. Strategy Recommendations and Implementation Plan**

*Note: Progression into Phase 4 will be dependent on the outcomes of
Phase 2 and will be mutually decided upon between the Endeavour team and
CIM.*

The final stage of the engagement is Stage 4. Activities in this stage
will be guided by the results of our evaluation of CIM's existing
fundraising model in Stage 3. In this stage, the engagement team will
further identify fundraising opportunities based on their ability to
contribute to the 5-year strategic plan agreed upon in Stage 2. As per
the problem definition, activities will concentrate on the
identification of funding opportunities alternative to CIM's current
reliance on diabetes-sector companies, along with key messaging, a
strategy for pursuing these opportunities, and guidelines, or
recommendations, for implementing the strategy.

    > including but not limited to, financial reports, development
    > plans, publications, program guides, participants' feedback and
    > participant surveys

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The client will provide external stakeholder contact information to
    > the best of their ability

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The Endeavour team will adhere to dates identified in the timeline.
    > If unforeseen circumstances arise, and timelines and deliverables
    > are affected, the team will immediately communicate problems with
    > the client

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The consulting team is committed to contributing 5-8 hour per week

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The client will answer all questions asked by the Endeavour team to
    > the best of their abilities

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Stakeholder participation to facilitate primary research

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Formal and informal feedback mechanisms are in place to allow for
    > frequent revisions and project improvements

The following constraints have been identified and reviewed by the
Endeavour team as well as communicated with the client:

-   There is no budget available for paid private research papers and
    > informational databases

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The client may have limited resources for implementation; the team
    > will consider these limitations in formulating its recommendations
    > to the client.

<!-- -->
```
-   Any unexpected occurrences may lead to reduced commitments by either
    > the client or the team member(s).

10. Communications Plan

Communications between the EVCN consulting team and Connected In Motion
will take place based on the following protocol:

-   **Full-scale client meetings**: The team will plan to have at least
    two (2) full-scale client meetings involving multiple members of the
    CIM exec / board for the purposes of presenting Interim
    results/report and the Final Recommendations. These meetings will
    utilize in-person and conference calling for individuals outside of
    Toronto, to allow the Endeavour team to provide detailed updates on
    status, interim deliverables, and ask outstanding questions that
    require a group-wide consensus response.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Status updates**: Bi-weekly status updates by the Engagement
    Manager or other Consultant as the team designates, either email or
    conference call as agreed upon discussing current activities, next
    steps, and following-up on document requests and outstanding
    questions to be conducted via phone with follow-up emails. These
    updates will not involve the full Endeavour or CIM teams unless
    agreed upon.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Ad-hoc status updates, questions, or logistical arrangements to be
    conducted either entirely via email, or if via phone to be scheduled
    first and followed up after via email.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The engagement manager from EVCN and the President-elect from the
    CIM remain the primary points of contact for ongoing communications.
