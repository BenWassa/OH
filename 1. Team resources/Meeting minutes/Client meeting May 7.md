\- Lost a lot of funding

\- We were running great but one old Board member went after Trillium
funding

\- All of the power is with Maggie (Founder/ED)

\- \$15K a month being lost right now

\- Not sure how to keep everyone employed

\- Other issue: supportive house is long-term -- who is going to look
after them?

\- Grew too much and now can't sustain them

\- Supportive housing will continuously be funded

\- 15K plus insurance 11K a year then incidentals

\- Joni was making 600 a month then 3000

\- Maggie's not a board member

\- Grants: advertise in the hospital with a display board and on TV (who
we were and lecture series)

\- Joni brings in a lot of caregivers

\- Robert has 22 clients --

\- How long will you last? What does the math look like?

\- Need grants that are a little big more predictable

\- Need \$ for salaries: 60K in a year

\- Financials -- how long? How much \$ is needed? Estimated \$60K
